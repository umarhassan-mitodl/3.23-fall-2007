description: Lecture presentation on band structure of direct-and indirect-gap semiconductors,
  carriers in thermal equilibrium, density of available states, the law of mass action,
  consequences for intrinsic semiconductors and extrinsic semiconductors, impurity
  levels, the hydrogen model of donors, acceptor states, and temperature dependence
  of majority carriers.
